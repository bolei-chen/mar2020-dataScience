Hello Everyone,
  Donna Mae Starr here, (otherwise known as: Sweet Georgia Brown),
  Well, usually you'd be getting Ray Starr writing the opening greeting, but I decided it's Ray's birthday and besides I wanted to see how it felt being behind the mic.  Or in this case because it's the e-mail format, to see how it felt being behind the computer-key-board and writing to the Ray Starr Fans, for the February issue.
  So, here I am, Donna Mae Starr, (a k a, Sweet Georgia Brown).  It's been awesome getting various articles and letters together, along with the standard columns you all look forward to checking out.  This February issue is filled with all kinds of interesting tid-bits, such as: Stars in the News, Story behind the Song, Recipe Box, The Birthday Corner for February, letters to Ray Starr etc.
  Well, it's time to call Ray into the studio-room,  so that we both can sit in front of the master controls, put our head-phones on, and turn to the first article.  But first, before Ray gets in here, I have to put up balloons, get out the party hats, carry in all of the wishes, see if the country band has their equipment set-up and check on the birthday cake and other snacks, like cookies provided by Debbie's recipe box, before all of you arrive with e-mail greetings.

  Actually, Ray, I have a big surprise for You.  Through-out this news-letter you'll hear from various members, friends, neighbors, musicians, fans, and family: With Birthday Wishes.
  So, let's have a few of you step to the mic, with your birthday wishes.
