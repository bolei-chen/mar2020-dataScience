I just received your email today, indicating that you have not selected me for an interview for the Sales Manager position. Although it was a real disappointment, I appreciate that you conveyed me your decision. I also appreciate the courtesy and professionalism exhibited in your interview rejection letter. 
I further, want to ingeminate my strong interest in working for your corporation. Please keep me in mind when you have another opening in the near future. Again, thank you and best wishes to your company.
