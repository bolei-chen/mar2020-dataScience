Thanks for taking the time <insert ‘today’ or ‘yesterday’> to discuss the role of <insert role name>. It was great to meet you. 
I was really impressed with <insert detail about the role that was highlighted in the interview, such as ‘the vision of the company’ or ‘the great company culture’ or ‘the opportunities for career development’> that you described. 
As we discussed, I’m confident that my skills and experience, most specifically <list specific skills/experience that are relevant> are a great match for the role.
<If you connected with your potential manager over something personal, here is a good time to mention it. For example, ‘I hope you have a wonderful time at Aria restaurant this weekend – the chocolate soufflé is my favourite dessert.’ Or ‘I hope your son enjoys his football match this weekend.’ If you didn’t unearth any personal details, don’t make it up or force it.>
I am available to meet with you any time, should you have any further questions. I look forward to hearing from you again. 
Best regards,
