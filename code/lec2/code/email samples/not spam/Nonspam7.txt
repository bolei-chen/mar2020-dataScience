Happy, Happy Birthday Ray,
Just wanted to be one of the first in line to wish you A Happy Birthday and if you need any help in blowing out the candles, all 59 of them, remember all you have to do is call on your Country Club members.  Oh yes, don't forget the ice cream and that famous Coca-cola-cake from Cracker Barrel! I'll have two scoopes of ice cream on my slice of cake, Thanks.
Hat's off to you, Ray.
Patrick Haske,
