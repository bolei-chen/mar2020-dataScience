................ Moderator's Comments ..................


First, let me explain why we have not published in ove r8 weeks.
Technical difficulties with our server caused us major problems.
Our volume of e.mail brought our server down and we had to change
equipment and programming.  Our newsletter now reaches 50,000+
Screen Printers and Digital Imagers worldwide.


Also, we want to thank our many customers, who over the past year
have made David's Distributing, Inc. grow larger and wiser.  Our aim
is to maximize service to the industry by efficiently providing quality
products which are very competitively priced.  We also freely exchange
our knowledge with all who ask our advice, and with our 35 years of 
experience we have been able to help solve problems for well over 
one thousand screen printers around the world.


The year 1999 is going to be very exciting and interesting.  There  
are a number of new products on the horizon to help printers
become more efficient and more productive.  Here are just a few.

Computer Software / Caltex 5.0.  


Software for the Screen Printer seems to be in great demand.  In
February we will be marketing a Textile Printer's Calculation 
Program that has been specifically designed for this industry but
can be used by other screen printers to calculate printing costs and
selling prices of specific items.


The program can be used by small and large businesses and is 
adaptable to your personal wishes.  Fast and accurate calculating 
of prices is an easy job. 
Printers may say: "We already have a price list"!  
Why spend money on a calculating program?  
Never make a miscalculation?
Our program provides the ability to not only program your price
turning points in printing but in the garment you sell as well.
